This file is the most important File for this Project. [-Cake-]

There are certain points to be covered for this project to take success

-> Client -- Flynn
-> Server -- Valkirye 

note: Bob and alice are used in a diffrent protocol section of this project so please try to understand the new technical terms.

Protocols:-

1. Lu - for the conncetion
2. Mu - for bonding two Devices
3. Paris Protocol - To keep the connection alive between devices. [in simple CS terms mariage between two devices across the world.]
4. Client [flyn] has a MOUSSE MSG to accept or decline 


Steps to be done and devices Questions to be answred:-

1. The Lu protocol will be alive forever in Client side [flyn] and the server side [valkirye] should intiatie something or the client will DIE.

2. The Mu protocol will wait till a good Lu protocol message comes from the Server [valkirye] because the connection as to be established forever.

3. If the Server decide paris Protocl has to be done with the client it has to follow certain messaging protocols to be follwed.

4. If the Server Decided to estavlish paris Protocol with Client then it has to be ready to pull of the next Protocol.

  4.1. The Mousse Protocol will have be accepted at any circumstance or in case of emergency.

5. The Client is waiting for a permanent Lu protocol and paris protocol from the server [valkirye].

6. If the sever verifies everthing in the client side and what ever the secuirty measure that the sever takes will be and have to be accepted by the client.

7.IMPORTANT - If NO (or) negative Lu and Mu and Paris Protocol then the client [flyn] will die.


This is the basic princlple of the projcet. Please review the message and client [flyn] which is the the most important part because it will be have many codes line to 

know wheather server [valkirye] would accept it or not.



IMPORTANT.
--> in javascript there is a function called PROMISE and AWAIT. the same function is follwed here. The PROMISE function is excuted in the client [flyn]

and AWAIT is being follwed till the Lu , Mu , paris protocol to be there from server [valkirye]. 



IMPORTANT
--> NEVER ever care ablout MOUSSE in client [flyn] or server [valkirye] because at anypoint of time if the there is a emrgency or Lu protocol between

client and server let the server decide. The client [flyn] has protocol decison of Lu because it need the communication and Paris protocol to act accordingly.
